# Mentora
AI-powered query resolution system for Gautam Buddha University using RAG, OCR, and vector search to provide quick, accurate answers from university circulars and notices.

## My Contributions
This was a collaborative team project. My primary contributions include:
- Led data collection and preprocessing of university notices and circulars
- Cleaned and structured OCR-extracted text for vector embedding and retrieval
- Assisted in testing the RAG pipeline and evaluating response quality
- Supported backend API integration and project documentation
